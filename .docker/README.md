# Drude (**Dru**pal **D**ocker **E**nvironment)
Docker and Docker Compose based environment for Drupal.

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/blinkreaction/drude.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/blinkreaction/drude)

<a name="requirements"></a>
## Requirements

Docker is natively supported only on Linux.  
Mac and Windows users will need a tiny linux VM layer - [Boot2docker Vagrant Box](https://github.com/blinkreaction/boot2docker-vagrant)

### Mac and Windows

1. Get the [Boot2docker Vagrant Box](https://github.com/blinkreaction/boot2docker-vagrant) up and running.

### Linux
1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-docker)
2. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)

<a name="setup"></a>
## Setup

Drude initial setup is done once per project (e.g. by a team lead).  
Once installed into the project repo, Drude can be used by anyone on the team.  
To use Drude each team member will need to meet the [requirements](#requirements) outlined above.

`docker-compose.yml` fiel and `.docker` folder are good indicators of Drude's presence in the project repo.

The installation process is slightly different based on the OS.

### Mac

 1. Make sure your site's docroot is in `</path/to/project>/docroot`.
 2. Edit `settings.php` for the site (see [Drupal settings](#drupal-settings) below).
 3. cd `</path/to/project>` and run:

    ```
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blinkreaction/drude/master/install.sh | bash
    ```
    
 4. Start containers with `dsh up`

### Windows

 1. Make sure your site's docroot is in `</path/to/project>/docroot`.
 2. Edit `settings.php` for the site (see [Drupal settings](#drupal-settings) below).
 3. Open Git Bash shell and cd into `</path/to/project>`, then run:

    ```
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blinkreaction/drude/master/install.sh | bash
    ```
    
 4. Start and login into vagrant, cd into `</path/to/project>`:
 
    ```
    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh
    cd </path/to/project>
    ```

 5. Start containers with `dsh up`

### Linux

 1. Make sure your site's docroot is in `</path/to/project>/docroot`.
 2. Edit `settings.php` for the site (see [Drupal settings](#drupal-settings) below).
 3. cd `</path/to/project>` and run:

    ```
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blinkreaction/drude/master/install.sh | bash
    ```

 4. Start containers with `dsh up`

<a name="updates"></a>
## Updates

To update Drude run the following from the `</path/to/project>` folder:

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blinkreaction/drude/master/install.sh | bash

Review the changes, revert any local overrides that were reset and commit into your project git repo.

Base images will be updated from time to time. Docker Compose does not automatically pull new image versions.
To get an up-to-date version of the entire stack do:

    docker-compose pull
    docker-compose up -d

## Drupal settings

Below you will find instructions on configuring you Drupal project to work with Drude.
Some settings are required, others are optional or enahncements. Please review carefully.

**Required**
- [DB connection settings](.docker/docs/drupal-settings.md#db)
- [File permissions fix](.docker/docs/drupal-settings.md#file-permissions)

**Optional**
- [Memcache settings](.docker/docs/drupal-settings.md#memcache)

<a name="dsh"></a>
## Drude Shell (dsh)

Drude shell (dsh) is a console tool that simplifies that day-to-day work with Drude.
It provide a set of most commonly used commands and operations for controlling the Boot2docker VM, containers, running drush and other console commands inside the **cli** container.

See `dsh help` for a complete list:

    Usage: dsh <command> [params]
    Commands list:

      start (up)    Start vagrant vm (mac only) and docker containers -OR- restarts docker containers
      stop (down, halt) Stop vagrant vm (mac only) or stop containers
      reload (restart)  Re-start vagrant vm (mac only) and docker containers
      status (st, ps)   Show vm/containers status
      bash      Start bash on cli container
      exec (run)    Execute a command in cli container (usage: dsh exec <command> [param] [param] [param]...)
      mysql     Opens mysql shell to drude database
      mysql-import    Truncate database and import from sql dump (usage: dsh mysql-import <filename>)
              Note: <filename> should be inside your project root
      drush     Shorthand for executing drush commands (usage: dsh drush [command] [options])
      cc      Shorthand for clearing caches (usage: dsh cc [cache_type] ("dsh cc" is equal to "dsh cc all")
      help      Output this help
      ...

`dsh` is automatically installed when you install Drude via the [install.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blinkreaction/drude/master/install.sh) script

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blinkreaction/drude/master/install.sh | bash

`dsh` detects the environment it's launched in and will automatically start the boot2docker VM and launch containers as necessary.
It runs on Mac/Linux directly. On Windows `dsh` runs inside the boot2docker VM.

## Console tools (cli)

**cli** container is ment to serv as a single console to access all necessary command line tools.

- ruby, bundler
- node, npm, bower, grunt
